                      The number of projects ePD has done for us continues to
                      grow, which should speak for itself. Their responsiveness
                      and technical expertise make working with them a pleasure.
                      I would highly recommend them.

                      ePD has worked with our mental health nonprofit to
                      integrate mood tests and other tools into our website. The
                      ePD team works efficiently with great attention to detail.
                      They are especially helpful at explaining complex concepts
                      to those outside of the web development world. Five out of

                      The patient monitoring simulation products developed by
                      ePD have had a positive impact on our training processes
                      and measurement of clinical competency. We feel the
                      computer-based replication of the medical equipment has
                      helped us save time while reducing the cost of training.
                      The use of the “virtual patient monitors” has allowed us
                      to train over 60 nurses concurrently without using the
                      equipment needed for patient care.

                      Kurt and his team at eProcess Development are a one stop

                      site security and everything between is critical. He has
